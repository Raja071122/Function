        "A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function or an expression. It allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of values, but instead of storing all the values in memory at once, it generates them on the fly, one at a time.

        "yield Keyword: The yield statement is used to define a generator. It pauses the function and returns a value, but retains the functionâ€™s state, so the next time the generator is called, it resumes execution right after the yield.\n",
